							<h3>honeygrow</h3>
							<p><a href="http://honeygrow.com" target="_blank">http://honeygrow.com</a></p>
							<p>Designed by Jen Denis, Chief Brand Officer of honeygrow, this project is the 2nd iteration of the honeygrow website which required a custom theme for a Drupal 7 website. The process for this allowed us to reuse the Drupal 7 site that was already in place, and build a new theme on top of the existing content scheme, reusing the majority of the work that was already in place.   Alterations and additions to the content type scheme and functionality were deployed using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features" target="_blank">Features</a> to make sure the changes deployed to the hosting environment did not break the production website while launching, and greatly streamlining that process.  The custom theme integrates a significant amount of custom work to allow for high fidelity scaling background images and html5 videos for a rich descriptive experience... ...coming close to telling you how delicious the food is.</p>

							<h3>Tavern on the Green</h3>
							<p><a href="http://tavernonthegreen.com" target="_blank">http://tavernonthegreen.com</a></p>
							<p>Designed by Nicole Hagedorn in partnership with <a href="http://kbotconsulting.com/" target="_blank">KBot Consulting.</a><br /><br />

							With the reopening of Tavern on the Green NYC, there was an opportunity to present a modern design and powerful technology platform to support the marketing and communication needs of the historically famous restaurant, while supporting its 21st century needs.<br /><br />

							Alphex Information Solutions was selected as the Lead Technology Consultant for this project to assist in the technical architecture, design production coordination, application development and launch of this website. Along with a series of secondary systems to support the business on the web, Alphex Information Solutions continues to provide top-to-bottom support and management of the entire domain.<br /><br />

							This site was built using Drupal 7, utilizing the immense flexibility of the platform for the management and ordering of content in unique ways across the site. The visual design and rich media requirements of the property required us to select a platform that would allow for ease of use, and ease of theming to meet the unique design requirements.<br /><br />

							With the history of the restaurant and the incredible amount of press that was covering opening day, we hosted the site with <a href="http://getpantheon.com" target="_blank">Pantheon</a>. Pantheon is an enterprise class hosting platform for Drupal, and between the platform choice and the powerful hosting package, the site was able to support over 200,000 page views in the first 20 days of operation. Impressive conversion rates were made between people visiting the site, and completing reservations to have a meal at the restaurant after its opening day.  You can read more about the launch success <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/how-launch-without-reservations-tavern-green-gets-details-right-pro-website-alphex-pantheon" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
