								<h3>USFCA - Flagship Website</h3>
								<p><a href="http://usfca.edu" target="_blank">http://usfca.edu</a></p>
								<p>In partnership with <a href="http://happycog.com" target="_blank">Happycog</a> &amp; <a href="http://fastspot.com" target="_blank">Fastspot</a> - Alphex was hired by Happycog to provide principal technical leadership in the planning &amp; development of a large scale Drupal 7 website for the University of San Francisco.  Over the course of 8 months Alphex distilled the visual &amp; interactive designs provided by Fastspot in to an architectural plan for a complex content management solution that enables 50 content authors and editors, in a proscribed workflow, to manage and expand the content and scope of the usfca.edu website as they see fit.  Implementing what we call a Component Library solution in Drupal allows the USFCA web team to assemble pages for any part of the site that are not limited by a set of templates or design decisions made prior to the need of the day.  They have at their disposal a collection of tools that meet the design aestehtic to custom deliver content structures and content presentations that meet the communication need, with out being forced to use -or abuse- templates and design limitations that don't meet their business needs.  Duran Goodyear, for the team, was responsible for daily project management interactions and project management practice leadership, while coordinating the work of 3 developers and 2 designers over the better half of 2015 to complete this exciting project.</p>

								<h3>honeygrow</h3>
								<p><a href="http://honeygrow.com" target="_blank">http://honeygrow.com</a></p>
								<p>Designed by Jen Denis, Chief Brand Officer of honeygrow, this project is the 2nd iteration of the honeygrow website which required a custom theme for a Drupal 7 website. The process for this allowed us to reuse the Drupal 7 site that was already in place, and build a new theme on top of the existing content scheme, reusing the majority of the work that was already in place.   Alterations and additions to the content type scheme and functionality were deployed using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features" target="_blank">Features</a> to make sure the changes deployed to the hosting environment did not break the production website while launching, and greatly streamlining that process.  The custom theme integrates a significant amount of custom work to allow for high fidelity scaling background images and html5 videos for a rich descriptive experience... ...coming close to telling you how delicious the food is.</p>

								<h3>Tavern on the Green</h3>
								<p><a href="http://tavernonthegreen.com" target="_blank">http://tavernonthegreen.com</a></p>
								<p>Designed by Nicole Hagedorn in partnership with <a href="http://kbotconsulting.com/" target="_blank">KBot Consulting.</a><br /><br />
								With the reopening of Tavern on the Green NYC, there was an opportunity to present a modern design and powerful technology platform to support the marketing and communication needs of the historically famous restaurant, while supporting its 21st century needs.<br /><br />
								Alphex Information Solutions was selected as the Lead Technology Consultant for this project to assist in the technical architecture, design production coordination, application development and launch of this website. Along with a series of secondary systems to support the business on the web, Alphex Information Solutions continues to provide top-to-bottom support and management of the entire domain.<br /><br />
								This site was built using Drupal 7, utilizing the immense flexibility of the platform for the management and ordering of content in unique ways across the site. The visual design and rich media requirements of the property required us to select a platform that would allow for ease of use, and ease of theming to meet the unique design requirements.<br /><br />
								With the history of the restaurant and the incredible amount of press that was covering opening day, we hosted the site with <a href="http://getpantheon.com" target="_blank">Pantheon</a>. Pantheon is an enterprise class hosting platform for Drupal, and between the platform choice and the powerful hosting package, the site was able to support over 200,000 page views in the first 20 days of operation. Impressive conversion rates were made between people visiting the site, and completing reservations to have a meal at the restaurant after its opening day.  You can read more about the launch success <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/how-launch-without-reservations-tavern-green-gets-details-right-pro-website-alphex-pantheon" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
